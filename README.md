# JIRA Time logs viewer

## Getting started

1. Create a JIRA API token from https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Rename .env-sample file as .env

   > **_NOTE:_** .env-sample will be shown as a hidden file in macos / linux environments

3. Update content in .env as needed

   > **_NOTE:_** JIRA_USER_NAME and USER_NAME properties should be emails.

4. Use relevant os executable file and keep both executable file and .env at the same folder level
5. Run executable file from terminal (git-bash for windows)

```
./team-time-logs-macos
```

```
./team-time-logs-win.exe
```
